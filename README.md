# Fuzzy-Sorting
This mini project was made during the Algorithms, Data Structures and Software Engineering for Media Technology course at Aalborg University. It is based on the computational problem, Fuzzy Sorting of Intervals, put forward by CLRS (2009). 

All data used within this project is generated randomly during runtime. The original data and their order is included with the export once an algorithm has been run.
